## Massage

### Swedish Massage

As the most basic of massage modalities, the main purpose of Swedish massage is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the muscles. It is recommended for persons who are just looking to relax and for those who have never received massage before or don't receive it very often. 

### Deep Tissue Massage

Deep tissue massage is a slow, intense and detailed massage on the area(s) that is/are giving the most problems. Your muscles lie under your skin's surface in layers. If the muscles causing you pain are located in the deeper layers, your therapist will take time warm up the superficial layers surrounding them before "digging" into those deeper ones. This is not the same as firm, therapeutic "deep pressure", which is often mistaken to mean the same. Many clients tend to ask for a deep tissue massage when they really just prefer firmer pressure throughout their massage. Repeated sessions may be required for long-standing conditions. 

### Sports Massage

Before, during, or after an athletic event, your therapist will focus on the muscles used during your activities and give you specialized stretches. You may hire a therapist to be on-site during an event for an additional out-call fee. 

### Trigger Point Therapy

A trigger point describes a taught band of skeletal muscle located within a larger muscle group. Trigger points are tender to the touch and can refer pain to distant parts of the body. A client may have regional, persistent pain resulting in a decreased range of motion in the affected muscles. Your therapist will work to locate the irritated triggerpoint and de-activate it. Treatment of trigger points may require repeated sessions for long-standing conditions.

## Couples Massage

Imagine stepping into a warm, cozy room filled with soft candlelight, rose petals scattered all about, and a serenade of hushed music. You and your loved one slip under crisp, fresh sheets just before your two personal massage therapists walk in. You note a hint of lavender in the air and hear the gentle sound of massage oil being warmed in your therapist hands. You and your partner take in one last glimpse of one another before closing your eyes and escaping into an hour of luxury and relaxation.

## Spa

### Hot Stone Massage

Warm, soothing stones are placed on key pressure points to melt away tension and stress. The stones are then used to massage the muscles and help improve circulation. This technique is highly therapeutic. One massage stroke with a heated stone is like receiving ten strokes from your therapist's hand alone.

### Face Massage 

One of the first visible signs of stress are facial expressions. You may often catch yourself clenching your jaws and furrowing your brow during the many intense moments of life. Ease the tension, tone other facial muscles, increase blood circulation, and relieve headaches with a face massage. This can also help to drain your sinuses.
