Whether you're celebrating a special occassion or simply treating yourself to an indulgent spa session, a couples massage is a great way for you and your loved one to relax and rejuvenate. Despite the suggestive name, couples massages are not just for couples; friends and family members can also enjoy this luxurious experience together.

 For a couples session, massage therapy is usually intended for relaxation purposes rather than the healing of an injury or pain relief. Swedish Massage, the most basic form of massage is often used in couples massage for its relaxing effects.  Should you or your partner like your therapist to focus on any areas of pain or tension, you can easily upgrade to a therapeutic massage for just $10 per-person.  Your therapist will combine a variety of healing techniques to tailor-craft your massage to fit your personal needs.  These techniques may include, but are not limited to Deep Tissue, Trigger Point Therapy,  Myofascial Release, Neuromuscular Therapy, and Active Isolated Stretching.

### Hot Towels

The use of hot, moist towels in massage therapy, also known as hydro thermal therapy, can help tight muscles to relax, soothes irritated nerve endings and increases circulation. They are warm and soothing and great for removing oil after a massage. Choose 3 for Back and Feet or Hands and Neckline, or get all 6.

This technique is highly therapeutic. One massage stroke with a heated stone is like receiving ten strokes from your therapist's hand alone. Choose from one of the following:

### Face Massage

One of the first visible signs of stress are facial expressions. You may often catch yourself clenching your jaws and furrowing your brow during the many intense moments of life. Ease the tension, tone other facial muscles, increase blood circulation, and relieve headaches with a face massage. This can also help to drain your sinuses.
