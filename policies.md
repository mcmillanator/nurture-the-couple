Reservation Policy: All new clients and couples massages are required to reserve their appointment with a credit card. This it so show your respect for our therapists time. The card is not charged unless the following cancellation policy is broken.

Cancellation Policy: Kindly give 48 hours notice to change or cancel your appointment to avoid any cancellation fee. All first time clients must reserve their appointment on a credit card. If cancelling the day prior to your appointment, cancellation fee is half of the price of your scheduled service. Full price will be charged for cancellation the day of your appointment time and for a no call/no show. If you have a gift certificate, there will be a $25 cancellation fee, and a no call/no show will forfeit your certificate. If you have a 30-minute promotional certificate, you will be charged the same as a full-priced appointment.

Lateness Policy: Please arive 5-10 minutes before your scheduled appointment time to fill out any paper work. If you arrive late, your time may be shortened at your practitioners discretion, so that the next client may start on time. You are responsible for full payment for the time as scheduled.
