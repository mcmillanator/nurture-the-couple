It is our top priority to provide you not only with a great massage, but with the best hospitable service from the moment you call til you walk out the door.  Many couples have enjoyed their experience with us.  We hope you will too.

### Kathleen K. - 4 months ago

We were passing through on an anniversary trip to the water's edge in Charleston. My husband and I booked a couples therapeutic massage. I had Jerome and my husband had Amy. Both were very knowledgeable and the massage was great. I recommend them if you are in the area and they were very accommodating for out of towners.

### Metodi M. - 6 Months Ago

Went there with my wife for a couples massage during our honeymoon in Charleston. We normally get a massage once a month back home, but this was incredible. We both felt much more relaxed and ready to enjoy the rest of the day after visiting. Only disappointed we can't go again anytime soon.

### Brad M. - 8 Months Ago

I have never had a Therapeutic Massage before but if they all felt as good as the ones that this place gave then I'd definitely go again. The atmosphere was pleasant/friendly and there wasn't a wait when I showed up. I had the couples massage (with my wife) and they used the hot stones, which were soothing.

### Katie D. - 9 Months Ago

My husband and I had a couples massage here for our anniversary.  The massage therapists were very friendly, and gave us both really great, relaxing massages.  We are already planning our next visit!  Thanks Amy and Angela!

### Sonja B. - 1 Year Ago

We had a great couples massage here. They are skilled at maternity massage and my husband described his as "phenomenal", one of the best he's had, focusing on getting substantial kinks out of his neck and shoulders.

### Rod E. - 2 Years Ago

Amazing experience on 2/26/16!  Superb therapists and couples massage with a great atmosphere.  Will definitely return the next time I am in the Charleston area.
