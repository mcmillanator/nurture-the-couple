Daily Special

## Simply Swedish Massage 
Get a 60-minute swedish massage any day of the week for only $70 ($160 for couples massage)! As the most basic of massage modalities, the main purpose of Swedish massage is to increase the oxygen flow in the blood and release toxins from the muscles. It is recommended for persons who are just looking to relax and for those who have never received massage before or don't receive it very often. If you have areas of pain or tension that you would like your therapist to focus on, then our regular therapeutic massage is recommended.
Weekly Specials

Not to mention, it smells wonderful! Free on Mondays, upon request; single oil only, regularly $10. Get $10 off a Signature or Custom blend.
